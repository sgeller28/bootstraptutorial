When do you think you might be able to use Bootstrap in the future? When would you not want to?
 - Bootstrap would be very helpful setting up general layouts for websites very quickly and free. I would definitely use this if I know the site I'm making will definitely be tested in the same environment as my own. Since Bootstrap is not always compatible with other platforms, I might be more hesitant to use it in those situations.
What are some issues/downsides you could run into by using Bootstrap in industry?
 - Bootstrap isn't always compatible with React and other platforms, so this won't necessarily work all the time. Bootstrap also does not allow for an incredible amount of customizability, so using Bootstrap might inhibit users from creating more unique sites.
